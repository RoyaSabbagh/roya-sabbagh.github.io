Autonomous mobile manipulation presents a hurdle prior to safely being able to utilize robots in real life applications such as healthcare and warehouse robots. In this article, we introduce a mobile manipulation framework based on model predictive control using learned dynamics models of objects. We focus on the specific problem of manipulating legged objects such as those commonly found in healthcare environments and personal dwellings (e.g. walkers, tables, chairs, equipment stands). We describe a probabilistic method for autonomous learning of an approximate dynamics model for these objects. In this method, we learn pre-categorized object models by using a small dataset consisting of force and motion interactions between the robot and object. In addition, we account for multiple manipulation strategies by formulating the manipulation planning as a mixed-integer convex optimization problem. The proposed manipulation framework considers the hybrid control system comprised of i) choosing which leg to grasp, and ii) continuous applied forces to move the object. We propose a manipulation planning algorithm based on model predictive control to compensate for modeling errors and find an optimal path to manipulate the object from one configuration to another. We show results for several objects with different wheel configurations. Simulation and physical experiments show that the obtained dynamics models are sufficiently accurate for safe and collision-free manipulation.

In fact, PGNGN leads to a general approach in order to obtain the topology of the workspace. In this algorithm, the network starts to grow by taking into account new data points close to its border neurons by resorting to the so-called boundary data generation procedure.\nBy considering singularity loci expression, the separated parts are detected and each part will pursue learning, adding units and connections, until a given performance criterion will be reached. Finally, after finding cavities, if any exists, the maximal circle for each part of the workspace is found. A graphical user interface (GUI) is developed providing the users with easy access to the important parameters in which the singularity-free workspace of three planar three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) parallel mechanisms are investigated in which two of them, namely, 3-RRR and 3-PRR parallel mechanisms, are among the most complicated parallel mechanisms due to their highly nonlinear and complicated singularity loci expressions. Results reveal the applicability and reliability of the proposed PGNGN-based approach for obtaining the singularity-free workspace of planar parallel mechanisms.\n maximal circle singularity-free workspace determination of 3-PRR planar parallel mechanism for its (þþþ) working mode.
